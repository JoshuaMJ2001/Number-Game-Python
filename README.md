# Number-Game-Python
A Number Game Created with Python

In this game, I am aiming to apply a wide range of my programming skills to individual activites which are selected by a menu.
In the game, the games/activities will include:
  - Rolling a dice / two die :dice:
  - Generating and guess numbers (1-10, 1-100, 1-1000)
  - Flipping a coin
  - Multiplication test
  - And much more.
